Follow the steps in ["Creating a personal access token for the command line"](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/) to create a token. After getting a token, follow these steps to start the app:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/emimuresan/githubber.git
$ cd githubber && touch .env
$ echo "GITHUB_TOKEN=<your token here>" > .env
$ yarn install
$ yarn ios OR yarn android
```

## Available Scripts

- `yarn ios` - start the app in the iOS simulator
- `yarn android` - start the app in the Android emulator
- `yarn lint` - runs eslint checks + fixes
- `yarn test` - runs available unit tests
